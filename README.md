## API Endpoints

- `GET/POST /api/inventory/items` — List/add inventory items
- `POST /api/inventory/import` — Bulk import from rough text
- `GET/POST /api/recipes` — List/add recipes
- `POST /api/suggest` — Get scored recipe suggestions

- `POST /api/cooklogs` — Log when you cook a recipe
- `GET/POST /api/techniques` — Manage cooking techniques

## Suggestion Scoring

The `/api/suggest` endpoint scores recipes based on:

- **Ingredient coverage** (60 pts max) — Do you have what's needed?
- **Missing penalty** (-12 per missing item) — Fewer missing = better
- **Expiring bonus** (+12) — Uses items about to expire
- **Time fit** (+8 within time, penalty for over)
- **Equipment match** (+8 if you have required equipment)
- **Tag matching** (+5/-6 for include/exclude tags)
- **Cuisine variety** (+15 for new cuisine, +8 if >3 weeks since last)
- **Technique growth** (+6-15 for learning opportunities)
- **Historical rating** (boost for highly-rated recipes)
- **Recency penalty** (-6 if made in last 2 weeks)

## Data Model Highlights

- **Item + ItemBatch** — Tracks multiple batches of the same item (different purchase/expiry dates)
- **Recipe** — Includes `cuisine`, `source`, `complexity`, `servingsMax` (for scalable recipes)
- **Technique** — Tracks difficulty and your comfort level (untried → learning → comfortable → confident)
- **RecipeTechnique** — Links recipes to techniques they teach

## Future Ideas

- Meal planning calendar
- Recipe import from URLs
- Barcode scanning for inventory
- Cost tracking per meal
- Nutrition data
- Integration with grocery delivery APIs
